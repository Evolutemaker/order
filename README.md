### State management
Simple state management, BLoC pattern
### Comments
- Added additional screen for adding the user, because i noticed the issue of user model absence on ordering page.
- Some dirty code on ordering_screen due to the absence of Decomposition of widgets, in other files
- UI and Layout of Figma file were displayed accordingly
